# Energy Consumption Prediction with XGBoost

This project demonstrates how to use the XGBoost algorithm for predicting energy consumption based on various features. XGBoost is a highly efficient and accurate algorithm for regression and classification tasks.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Supports any dataset with energy consumption as the target variable.
- **Regression Model**: Uses XGBoost for regression to predict energy consumption.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.
- **Visualization**:
  - Actual vs Predicted values.
  - Feature importance.

## How to Run
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Download an energy consumption dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI repository).
   - Save the dataset as `energy_data.csv` in the project directory.
